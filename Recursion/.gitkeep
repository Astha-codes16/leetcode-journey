//my approach
Basic backtracking question (take and not take approach) take and element explore its possibilities modifying n and k accordingly 
then pop the element(i.e dont take it) and now explore further for further elements (skipping the index we already explored for!!) 
    if(i>=v.size())
    {
        return;
    }
this line is to handle the edge case where k=9 and n is more than the total sum 
when we backtrack from the last step and i=8 and we make a call for i+1 (i.e) 9 which is an invalid index
