class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int count=0;
        while(start!=0 || goal!=0)
        {
            if((start%2==1 && goal%2==0)||(start%2==0 && goal%2==1))
            {
                count++;
            }
            start/=2;
            goal/=2;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
my approach==> we start with int start and int goal and check their last bit by doing num%2 
if num%2==1 means last bit is 1 and if num%2==0 means last bit is 0
and then we removite the last bit by doing num/2 and then again repeat the process 
we will keep doing this process until both are not zero  i.e jab tak ek bhi non zero hai tab tak 
loop chalate rho...
