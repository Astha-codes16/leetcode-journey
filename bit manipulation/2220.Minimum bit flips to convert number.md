class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int count=0;
        while(start!=0 || goal!=0)
        {
            if((start%2==1 && goal%2==0)||(start%2==0 && goal%2==1))
            {
                count++;
            }
            start/=2;
            goal/=2;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
my approach==> we start with int start and int goal and check their last bit by doing num%2 
if num%2==1 means last bit is 1 and if num%2==0 means last bit is 0
and then we removite the last bit by doing num/2 and then again repeat the process 
we will keep doing this process until both are not zero  i.e jab tak ek bhi non zero hai tab tak 
loop chalate rho...

2nd method==>
class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
       int ans=start^goal;
       int i=0;
       int count=0;
       while(ans!=0)
       {
        if(ans&1)
        {
            count++;
        }
        ans=ans>>1;
       }
       return count; 
    }
};
//instead of n/2 wecan do n>>1;
//instead of checking if(n%2==1) then last bit is 1 we can do n&1
//if n&1==1 then the last bit is odd otherwise it is even
