class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if(n<=0)
        {
            return false;
        }
        if((n & n-1)==0)
        {
            return true;
        }
    return false;}
};

in this question i used basic bit manipulation 

we know if n is a number such that it can be represented in power of 2 then it contains only one 1 in its binary form

after subtracting 1 from n all the succeeding 0 get converted to 1 and the only 1 get conver to zero
